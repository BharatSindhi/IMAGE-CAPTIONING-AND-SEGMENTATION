# image-captioning-and-segmentation 
This project focuses on the dual task of Image Captioning and Image Segmentation.

# Project Overview:
This project focuses on the dual task of Image Captioning and Image Segmentation. Image Captioning involves generating descriptive textual captions for a given image using deep learning models, while Image Segmentation involves identifying and labeling regions of an image with corresponding objects or categories. Combining these two tasks will give interns hands-on experience with computer vision, natural language processing, and deep learning concepts.

# Project Objectives
Understand and implement stateof-the-art models for image captioning.
Train and evaluate models on standard datasets (e.g., MS COCO, Pascal VOC)
Improve accuracy and performance of both tasks through experimentation.
Develop an integrated system that can caption and segment an image.
Perform semantic and instance segmentation on images
